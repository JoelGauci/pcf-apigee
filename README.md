# Technical Workshop Pivotal Cloud Foundry & Google Apigee

<img src="img/apigee-pivotal-cloud-foundry.png" width="500" height="339">

## Goal of this material
This material has been created for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and Google Apigee workshops.
**It consists in technical labs**, which will guide you in order to make you discover a typical usage of the 2 solutions.
The use case you will work on is called **"JAG"**: Just Another Gateway.
In order to understand this use case, we have created a step-by-step lab.
At this point of the workshop, please be sure instructors have provided the following topics:
    - access to an Apigee Edge demo organization, which is the Apigee Edge (SaaS) tenant you will work on. 
    - access to an PCF demo account, which is the place to create your Euro-Dollar application.

The Euro-Dollar application (aka **eurodol**) is a simple Java application that is able to convert currencies: Euro into Dollar and vice versa. 
Let's get started, and feel free to ask for any questions during the completion of the lab.

# 1. Step 1

In this lab, we use an hosted Pivotal Cloud Foundry instance:
[Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io). This instance
offers free credit to push apps to the Cloud: it's a great way
to discover the `cf push` experience.

<img src="img/pws-homepage.png"/>

## Step 1.1 - Create your PCF account

Go to https://run.pivotal.io, and
[create a free account](https://try.run.pivotal.io/homepage)
from the login page.

Sign-in using your account, and go to the
[Tools section](https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools).

Download the `cf` CLI tool from this page.
Follow instructions to login using the `cf` CLI tool:

<img src="img/pws-tools.png"/>

## Step 1.2 - Deploy the **eurodol** application

[Eurodol](https://github.com/alexandreroman/eurodol)
is a Cloud-native app, leveraging Spring Boot,
Spring Cloud & Vue.js. Using your PCF account, you're about to
push this app to the Cloud in no time.

<img src="img/eurodol-app.png"/>

From the [releases tab](https://github.com/alexandreroman/eurodol/releases),
download the latest version of the app.
You need to get the JAR file (`eurodol-X.jar`) and the
Cloud Foundry manifest (`manifest.yml`).

Now that you have the files on your workstation, open a terminal
and enter this command:
```bash
$ cf push --random-route
```

Your JAR file will be uploaded to Cloud Foundry: the platform will
take care of creating a container for you with all required
dependencies (Java Runtime Environment, Spring Boot support,
memory settings, etc.). You will end up with a domain registered for
your app instance: something like `eurodol-RANDOM-WORDS.cfapps.io`.

## Step 1.3 - Test the **eurodol** application

Your app is now up and running thanks to Cloud Foundry.
Using the public app endpoint, you're about to check if the app is
working as expected.

Get the public app endpoint using this command:
```bash
$ cf app eurodol
Showing health and status for app eurodol-test in org EMEA / space aroman as aroman@pivotal.io...

```

Look at section `routes`: this is how you can reach your app using a
browser. Hit this URL, and you should be able to access the app.

# 2. Step 2 - API Creation on the Apigee Edge SaaS platform

In this section, you connect to the Apigee Edge platform using your own account. After a quick introduction to the Apigee platform and main tabs, you start creating your first API Proxy and set its configuration.

## Step 2.1 - Connect to your Apigee organization
Before starting this lab, instructors have created an Apigee Edge (SaaS) demo account for each participant.
Accounts have been created with your email addresses. 
As a participant, please connect to your email inbox and activate your demo account, if not completed yet.

At this point, you should be able to access the Apigee Edge login screen, as shown here:

<img src="img/211-login-screen.png">

Once you are connected, you should be able to see the Apigee Edge home page, note that you work in the **emea-poc7** organization, as shown on the following picture:

<img src="img/212-apigee-org.png">

Here is an overview of the Apigee Edge home page:

<img src="img/213-apigee-home.png">

Also note that you are working with an __Organization Admninistrator__ role.

As, you can see, the home page consists in several icons:
- Specs : this is the place where you upload all your OpenAPI specification files. Then you can use these files to create API Proxies
- API Proxies : at this point, just consider an API Proxy as an "API Fa√ßade", on which you can add technical controls, in the form of mediation, traffic management, security policies as well as extensions.
- API Products : an API Product is a way to package a set of API Proxies. It can be used to define quotas, custom attributes, OAuth20 scopes and some other specific properties: visibility on the Developer Portal, approval mecahnism for application subscription...
- Portals : once you have created API Products, you can make them available through a Developer Portal

We have just covered here some aspects of an API life cycle...from the Design to the publication of product on a Developer Portal !

## Step 2.2 -  Upload the OpenAPI eurodol-v1 specification

Click on the **Specs** icon, or access the **specs** tab, as shown here:

<img src="img/221-specs-tab.png">

Click the **+Spec** button on the right and top side of the panel, as shown on the image, then select **Import URL...** :

<img src="img/222-plus-spec-button.png">

As **Import Name**, please enter a name of your convenience. Please be aware that this organization is also used by the other participants so you have to find a way to make the name of your file unique! Be creative, for instance you can add your initials to the name of the file: **eurodol-v1_YOUR-INITIALS** (eurodol-v1_jog in my case)

As **Import Url**, please copy and paste the following value: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoelGauci/pcf-apigee/master/apigee/specs/eurodol-v1.yaml

This points to the OpenAPI specification we use in this workshop. You can have a look at the specification if you click on the following link:

[eurodol-v1 OpenAPI specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoelGauci/pcf-apigee/master/apigee/specs/eurodol-v1.yaml)

Before clicking the **Import** button, you should check you get the following info (except the initials...), as shown on the picture: 

<img src="img/223-spec-import.png">

You can now click the **Import** button to import the OpenAPI specification into the orgqnization.

From the Specs list, find your **eurodol-v1** personal specification and click on it, as shown on the following picture:

<img src="img/224-open-spec.png">

This will show the content of your **eurodol-v1** specification, as shown here after:

<img src="img/225-eurodol-spec.png">

Important: you have to make a modification on this file...See the **{YOUR_PERSONAL_CODE}** pattern in the file...you should find it around line 16...

<img src="img/226-perso-pattern.png">

...modify the pattern with your own initials or a pattern of your convenience (do not include any special characters).
Please take note of these initials as you will have to use them later in the workshop.

```code
/{YOUR_PERSONAL_CODE}/api/v1
```

becomes

```code
/jog/api/v1
```

Here is an example of the result in my case, when using the initials **jog**:

<img src="img/227-jog-pattern.png">

Note that the base path starts with a '/'

Once you have made this change on the **eurodol-v1** specification, you can save it, clicking on the **Save** button on the right side of the screen, as shown here:

<img src="img/228-save-spec.png">

You should see a message, which confirms that the document has been saved

## Step 2.3 - Create an API Proxy, based on your OpenAPI **eurodol-v1** specification

Click the **API Proxies** tab from the section list, as shown on the following picture:

<img src="img/231-goto-apiproxies.png">

Then click on the **+Proxy** button on the right side of the screen, as shown here:

<img src="img/232-plus-apiproxy.png">

Select the **Reverse proxy** option and click the **Use OpenAPI** button as shown below:

<img src="img/233-reverse-proxy.png">

From the **My Specs** list, select your own and personal **eurodol-v1** specification and click the **Select** button

Then click the **Next** button, as shown on the following picture:

<img src="img/234-reverse-proxy-next.png">

This will start the creation process of your **eurodol** API Proxy...

On the next panel, please make some modification to make your API Proxy and its base path unique:
1. Add your initials to the name of the API Proxy: **eurodol-jog** in my case
2. Copy and paste the URI of the **Existing API** URL to the **Proxy Base Path** text field
3. Modify the value of the **Existing API** hostname with the value of your PCF app hostname : **https://eurodol-brash-lemur.cfapps.io** in my case 

Except your own initials and your own PCF app hostname, you should see something like this in term of API Proxy settings:

<img src="img/235-apiproxy-settings.png">

Also important is to "clean" the value of the **Existing API** field: remove your personal code from the URI.

At the end, you should see something like this:

<img src="img/23b5-apiproxy-settings.png">

If everything is checked on your side, you can click the **Next** button

Verify that the **GET /convert** resource will be exposed by the API Proxy. The check box must be selected and you can click the **Next** button, as shown on the following picture:

<img src="img/236-apiproxy-convert.png">

Then, select the **Pass through (none)** option and click **Next**, as shown here:

<img src="img/237-apiproxy-passthru.png">

Then, unselect the **default** virtual host as we only want to provide secured connection with our API Proxy and click **Next**, as shown here:

<img src="img/238-apiproxy-secure.png">

On the 2 other screens, just select the default options and click **Next**. You should then see a deployment status indicating that the deployment is successful. At this point, click on the name of your API Proxy, as shown on the following image:

<img src="img/239-apiproxy-status.png">

This will allow to access the configuration overview of your API Proxy, as shown here:

<img src="img/23A-apiproxy-overview.png">

## Step 2.4 Modify the configuration of your API Proxy

In this section, you will modify the configuration of your existing **eurodol** API Proxy in order to be able to test it from an API Developer Portal and from a Web browser based application.

CLick the **DEVELOP** tab of you API Proxy menu, as shown here:

<img src="img/241-apiproxy-develop.png">

From this tab, you can access the configuration details of your API Proxy.
First and foremost, we need to add a mediation policy that will handle CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) on our API Proxy. Click the **+** button on the **Policies** item on the left side of the panel (Navigator), as shown on the following picture:

<img src="img/242-apiproxy-addpolicy.png">

Select the **Assign Message Policy**, keep the default value (as display name and name for the policy) and click the **Add** button, as shown here after:

<img src="img/243-apiproxy-addAM.png">

This will create an Assign Message policy (a specific type of mediation policy) in the list of available policies, as shown on the following image:

<img src="img/244-apiproxy-AM.png">

Click the policy and you will access its XML configuration:

<img src="img/245-apiproxy-AM-xmlconfig.png">

All the policies in Apigee are based on an XML configuration. 
Copy the content of the following XML configuration, from the link below:
[Add-CORS.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoelGauci/pcf-apigee/master/apigee/config/Add-CORS.xml)

... or from the following code section:

```code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<AssignMessage async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Add-CORS">
    <DisplayName>Add CORS</DisplayName>
    <FaultRules/>
    <Properties/>
    <Set>
        <Headers>
            <Header name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin">*</Header>
            <Header name="Access-Control-Allow-Headers">origin, x-requested-with, accept, content-type, x-apikey</Header>
            <Header name="Access-Control-Max-Age">3628800</Header>
            <Header name="Access-Control-Allow-Methods">GET, PUT, POST, DELETE</Header>
        </Headers>
    </Set>
    <IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
    <AssignTo createNew="false" transport="http" type="response"/>
</AssignMessage>
```

...and paste it in the policy panel, as shown here:

<img src="img/246-apiproxy-AM-copygit.png">

You can check that the name of the Assign Message policy has changed. It is now **Add CORS**, as shown on the list of policies:

<img src="img/247-apiproxy-AM-name.png">

Click on the **Save** button on your API Proxy: on new dialog box opens, which proposes to save your API Proxy as a new revision. Click the **Save as New Revision** button, as shown here:

<img src="img/248-apiproxy-newrevision.png" width="50%">

Now, we are going to modify the configuration of the **eurodol-xxx** API Proxy. For this, please first click the **default** item from the **Proxy Endpoints** component in the Navigator section, as shown on the following picture:

<img src="img/249-apiproxy-proxyendpoints.png" width="100%">

Copy the content of the following proxy endpoint XML configuration, from the link below:
[Add-CORS.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoelGauci/pcf-apigee/master/apigee/config/proxy.xml)

... or from the following code section:

```code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
    <Description/>
    <FaultRules/>
    <DefaultFaultRule name="default-fault">
        <Step>
            <Name>Add-CORS</Name>
        </Step>
    </DefaultFaultRule>
    <PreFlow name="PreFlow">
        <Request/>
        <Response>
            <Step>
                <Name>Add-CORS</Name>
            </Step>
        </Response>
    </PreFlow>
    <PostFlow name="PostFlow">

    <Flows>
        <Flow name="get /convert">
            <Description/>
            <Request/>
            <Response/>
            <Condition>(proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/convert") and (request.verb = "GET")</Condition>
        </Flow>
        <Flow name="CORS preflight">
            <Description>CORS preflight</Description>
            <Request/>
            <Response>
                <Step>
                    <Name>Add-CORS</Name>
                </Step>
            </Response>
            <Condition>request.verb = "OPTIONS"</Condition>
        </Flow>
    </Flows>
    <HTTPProxyConnection>
        <BasePath>/{YOUR_PERSONAL_CODE}/api/v1</BasePath>
        <Properties/>
        <VirtualHost>secure</VirtualHost>
    </HTTPProxyConnection>
    <RouteRule name="NoRoute">
        <Condition>request.verb == "OPTIONS"</Condition>
    </RouteRule>
    <RouteRule name="default">
        <TargetEndpoint>default</TargetEndpoint>
    </RouteRule>
</ProxyEndpoint>
```

...and paste it in the proxy endpoint policy panel, as shown here:

<img src="img/24A-apiproxy-proxyendpoints-config.png" width="100%">

From the display panel of the **default** proxy endpoint (just above the configuration you have modified), change the value of the **{YOUR_PERSONAL_CODE}** tag:

<img src="img/24B-apiproxy-proxyendpoints-tag.png" width="100%">

Once you have this modification, please save your API Proxy, using the **Save** button, as shown on the following image:

<img src="img/24C-apiproxy-proxyendpoints-save.png" width="100%">

Once your API Proxy has been saved, clicke the **Deployment** selection list, and choose the **test** environment, as shown here:

<img src="img/24D-apiproxy-deploy-test.png" width="100%">

On the dialog box, which opens click the **Deploy** button to finalize the deployement of your API Proxy on the **test** environment:

<img src="img/24E-apiproxy-deploy-confirm.png" width="100%">

Please check the deployment has been successfully executed: clicking on the **Deployment** selection list, you should see a green point related to the **test** environment:

<img src="img/24F-apiproxy-deployment-ok.png" width="50%">

Congratulations!!! Your API Proxy is now operational.


# 3 Step 3 - Test your API Proxy using the Trace & Debug tool

In this section, you are going to test your own **eurodol** API Proxy using the Apigee Edge's **Trace & Debug tool**

First, switch to the **Trace** section of your API Proxy, as shown here:

<img src="img/301-apiproxy-traces.png" width="50%">

You can see on the follwing picture an overview of the **Trace & Debug** panel. Please click the **Start Trace Session** green button to start a new trace session.
Please note a trace session is available during 10 minutes.

<img src="img/302-apiproxy-starttracesession.png" width="100%">

One the trace session has been activated, the **Trace Session** button becomes red and its text has changed to **Stop Trace Session**

Please add the following resource and filter information to the base path of your API Proxy, as shown here after:

```code
/convert?amount=100
```

<img src="img/303-apiproxy-complete-url.png" width="100%">

Then click the **Send** button to request the specific resource, as shown on the following picture:

<img src="img/304-apiproxy-trace-send.png" width="100%">

A transacation should appear on the left hand side of the **Trace** panel:

<img src="img/305-apiproxy-trace-transactions.png" width="100%">

You can follow the execution of you API Proxy and its policies using the **Trace** tool. You can access internal variables, context variables, request and response headers, payloads, URIs information....

<img src="img/306-apiproxy-trace-steps.png" width="100%">

Take some time to discover the **Trace & Debug** tool or ask for any questions to instructors in case yiuy need detailed inforamtion at this point of the workshop.

If you want to have a look on your PCF application response, click the circle just after the factory symbol (the provider or backend app/api). You will then be able to see the response of your backend app, as shown here:

<img src="img/307-apiproxy-trace-response.png" width="100%">

## Step 3.1 - Add Traffic Management (Quota Enforcement) and Security (Verify API Key) policies to your API Proxy

Stop the trace session and switch to the **Develop** tab. Select your API Proxy endpoint **Preflow** level, as shown here:

<img src="img/308-apiproxy-preflow.png" width="100%">

If you want to know more about API Proxy flows, please click the following link in order to access detailed documentation related to this topic: 

[API Proxy Flows](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/fundamentals/what-are-flows)

Click the **+Step** button at the request processing level, as shown on the following picture:

<img src="img/309-apiproxy-step.png" width="100%">

Select the **Verify API Key** policy (part fo the security policies) and click the **Add** button, as shown here:

<img src="img/30A-apiproxy-vak.png" width="100%">

On the policy XML configuration, change the APIKey ref attribute value:

<img src="img/30B-apiproxy-vak-apikey.png" width="100%">

```code
<APIKey ref="request.header.x-apikey"/>
```

This configuration means that your API Proxy enforces an API Key verification.  The API key that is enforced is extracted from an HTTP request header, whose name is **x-apikey**

Click the **+Step** again (on the request side), and add a **Quota** enforcement policy (from the traffic managememnt set of policies):

<img src="img/30C-apiproxy-quota.png" width="100%">

Click the **Quota** enforcement policy, copy the following configuration...

```code
<Quota continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Q-EnforceQuotaPerKey" type="calendar">
    <Allow count="10" countRef="verifyapikey.Verify-API-Key-1.apiproduct.developer.quota.limit"/>
    <Interval ref="verifyapikey.Verify-API-Key-1.apiproduct.developer.quota.interval">1</Interval>
    <TimeUnit ref="verifyapikey.Verify-API-Key-1.apiproduct.developer.quota.timeunit">minute</TimeUnit>
    <Identifier ref="verifyapikey.Verify-API-Key-1.client_id"/>
    <Distributed>true</Distributed>
    <Synchronous>true</Synchronous>
    <StartTime>2019-01-01 12:00:00</StartTime>
</Quota>
```

... and use it to replace the current quota policy configuration, as shown here:

<img src="img/30D-apiproxy-quota-config.png" width="100%">

As defined in the configuration, the quota will be used as defined in the product, in which the API Proxy will be packaged.
To know more about API Products, please contact your instructors or access the following link:
[API Product](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/publish/what-api-product)

Save the configuration of your API Proxy (remember you to click the **Save** button on the left hand side...)

# Step 4 - Wire PCF and Apigee Step 4 - Package your API Proxy into an API Product in Apigee Edge

At this point of the workshop, you cannot access your API Proxy without generating a (beautiful) 401 error code (as API Key verification will not be successfull).
In the following sections, we will create a developer, then an application (and therefore an **api key** and **api secret**).
We will then create an API Product, which will package your **eurodol-xxx** API Proxy that has been created so far. 
Finally, the API Product will be bound to this application and this will allow the application to consume the product and its embedded API Proxies...

## Step 4.1 - Create a developer
In order to create a developer, please click the **Publish** and then **Developers** tab, as shown here after:

<img src="img/411-publish-developers.png" width="50%">

Click the **+Developer** button, in order to add a new developer:

<img src="img/412-add-developer.png" width="50%">

You can define yourself as a new application developer, so please provide your personal information and click the **Create** button, as shown here:

<img src="img/413-create-developer.png" width="100%">

You should see a new developer (you) in the list of available developers. Information you have provided at the creation time are shown as a result:

<img src="img/414-developer-info.png" width="100%">

As you can see, no application has been linked to the developer. Let's create a developer app!

## Step 4.2 - Create an API Product 

From the **Publish** section, please select the **API Products** tab, as shown here after:

<img src="img/421-products.png" width="50%">

Click the **+API Product** button, as shown here:

<img src="img/422-add-products.png" width="50%">

Please enter the information related to your API Product. You should see mostly the same type of data except that you have to use your personal code (**jog** in the example):

<img src="img/423-product1.png" width="100%">

At the **API resources** level, please click the **+** button and select your own and personal API Proxy (**eurodol-xxx**), as shown here:

# 5 Step 5 - Create your own API Developer Portal

In this section we create a developer portal.

## Step 5.1 - Instanciate a Developer Portal from your Apigee Edge organization

In order to create a developer portal, please click the **Publish** and then **Portals** tab, as shown here after:

<img src="img/511-portals.png" width="50%">

Click the **+Portal** button, as shown here:

<img src="img/512-add-portal.png" width="100%">

Enter a name for your Developer Portal (an name of your convenience) and select a developer program, as shown here:

<img src="img/513-create-portal.png" width="100%">

Please wait for a few seconds and your dev portal is created!!!

<img src="img/514-dev-portal.png" width="100%">

Click the **Live Portal** link (at the right top of the screen) in order to access your developer portal:

# Step 8 - Wire PCF and Apigee

You successfully deployed an app to Cloud Foundry, and you now have an Apigee
proxy running: it's time to wire these two beasts together.

Run these commands to enable Apigee proxy support in the app:
```bash
$ cf set-env eurodol APP_APIKEY <your-api-key>
$ cf set-env eurodol APP_APIENV <your-personal-code>
$ cf set-env eurodol APP_APIENDPOINT <url-to-apigee-proxy>
```

Run this command to apply this configuration and reload the app:
```bash
$ cf restage eurodol
```

Use your browser to hit the app endpoint: all API calls are now
redirected to the Apigee proxy.
